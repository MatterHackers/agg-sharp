        // vmtx - Vertical Metrics Table

        //The vertical metrics table allows you to specify the vertical spacing for each glyph in a vertical font.
        //This table consists of either one or two arrays that contain metric information(the advance heights and top sidebearings)
        //for the vertical layout of each of the glyphs in the font.
        //The vertical metrics coordinate system is shown below.


        //Vertical Metrics Table Format

        //The overall structure of the vertical metrics table consists of two arrays shown below:
        //the vMetrics array followed by an array of top side bearings.
        //
        //The top side bearing is measured relative to the top of the origin of glyphs, 
        //for vertical composition of ideographic glyphs.
        //       
        //This table does not have a header, 
        //but does require that the number of glyphs included in the two arrays equals the total number of glyphs in the font.
        //
        //The number of entries in the vMetrics array is determined by the value of the numOfLongVerMetrics field of the vertical header table.
        //
        //The vMetrics array contains two values for each entry.
        //These are the advance height and the top sidebearing for each glyph included in the array.
        //
        //In monospaced fonts, such as Courier or Kanji, all glyphs have the same advance height.
        //If the font is monospaced, only one entry need be in the first array, but that one entry is required.
        //The format of an entry in the vertical metrics array is given below.

        //
        //Type      Name            Description
        //uint16    advanceHeight   The advance height of the glyph. Unsigned integer in FUnits
        //int16     topSideBearing  The top sidebearing of the glyph. Signed integer in FUnits.

        //The second array is optional and generally is used for a run of monospaced glyphs in the font.
        //Only one such run is allowed per font, and it must be located at the end of the font.
        //This array contains the top sidebearings of glyphs not represented in the first array,
        //and all the glyphs in this array must have the same advance height as the last entry in the vMetrics array.
        //All entries in this array are therefore monospaced.
        //
        //The number of entries in this array is calculated by subtracting the value of numOfLongVerMetrics from the number of glyphs in the font.
        //The sum of glyphs represented in the first array plus the glyphs represented in the second array therefore equals the number of glyphs in the font.
        //The format of the top sidebearing array is given below.
        //Type      Name                Description
        // int16    topSideBearing[]    The top sidebearing of the glyph. Signed integer in FUnits.
