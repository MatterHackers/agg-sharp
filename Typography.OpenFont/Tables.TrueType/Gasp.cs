        // This table contains information which describes the preferred rasterization techniques 
        //for the typeface when it is rendered on grayscale-capable devices. 
        //This table also has some use for monochrome devices,
        //which may use the table to turn off hinting at very large or small sizes, to improve performance.

        //At very small sizes, 
        //the best appearance on grayscale devices can usually be achieved by rendering the glyphs 
        //in grayscale without using hints. 
        //
        //At intermediate sizes, hinting and monochrome rendering will usually produce the best appearance. 
        //
        //At large sizes, the combination of hinting and grayscale rendering will
        //typically produce the best appearance.

        //If the 'gasp' table is not present in a typeface,
        //the rasterizer may apply default rules to decide how to render the glyphs on grayscale devices.
