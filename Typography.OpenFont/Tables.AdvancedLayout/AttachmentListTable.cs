    //Attachment List Table

    //The Attachment List table (AttachList) may be used to cache attachment point coordinates along with glyph bitmaps.

    //The table consists of an offset to a Coverage table (Coverage) listing all glyphs that define attachment points in the GPOS table,
    //a count of the glyphs with attachment points (GlyphCount), and an array of offsets to AttachPoint tables (AttachPoint). 
    //The array lists the AttachPoint tables, one for each glyph in the Coverage table, in the same order as the Coverage Index.
    //AttachList table
    //Type 	Name 	Description
    //Offset16 	Coverage 	Offset to Coverage table - from beginning of AttachList table
    //unint16 	GlyphCount 	Number of glyphs with attachment points
    //Offset16 	AttachPoint[GlyphCount] 	Array of offsets to AttachPoint tables-from beginning of AttachList table-in Coverage Index order

    //An AttachPoint table consists of a count of the attachment points on a single glyph (PointCount) and 
    //an array of contour indices of those points (PointIndex), listed in increasing numerical order.

    //Example 3 at the end of the chapter demonstrates an AttachList table that defines attachment points for two glyphs.
    //AttachPoint table
    //Type 	Name 	Description
    //uint16 	PointCount 	Number of attachment points on this glyph
    //uint16 	PointIndex[PointCount] 	Array of contour point indices -in increasing numerical order
