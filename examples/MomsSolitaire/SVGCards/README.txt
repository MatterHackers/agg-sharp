This complete set of 52 playing card faces is based off the standard set dating 
back to the late 1900's and in use in most modern decks today. The cards were 
initially scanned from a real deck at 600 DPI and then auto traced with Inkscape 
( www.inkscape.org ) as a starting point. Nearly every line/node was redrawn 
from this initial starting point and then optimized to decrease file size and 
create cleaner curves, sharper transitions, etc. 

For .SVG capable editors (Inkscape and Illustrator CS5 tested) the cards are 
offered individually (with and without crop marks) as a complete set of 52 (full 
color), as a complete set of 52 (gray-scale) and as a complete set of 52 (High 
contrast B/W). For those needing .eps, a complete conversion of all 52 faces (
singly) plus the two backs is also offered. A template with various card 
elements (pips, numbers, etc.) is included for those who wish to use the 
discrete objects. 

There is now also a small set of ESP cards added.
